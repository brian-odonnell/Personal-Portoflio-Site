# Personal-Portoflio-Site
This is the source code for my personal portoflio website site. It is using Webpack to build a basic Wordpress theme with PHP, the CSS preprocessor LESS, and vanilla JS (paired with Bootstrap).

## Watch CSS/JS
1. Go to root (where the file webpack.base.js is)
2. Run "npm run dev-build" in a terminal window
3. Make changes to CSS/JS files in "/src/scss" and "/src/js"
4. The code then compiles to "/themes/2020_Website/assets/css" and "/themes/2020_Website/assets/js"
5. Upload via FTP


## Edit HTML/PHP
1. Go to "/themes/2020_Website"
2. Edit PHP files like a normal Wordpress site
3. Upload via FTP
